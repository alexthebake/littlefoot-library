## System Definition
### Return Record
For each book that is returned, the system needs to record the following information:
- Title
- Author
- Number of pages
- Dewey Decimal Number
- If the book was read, partially read, or unread

### Reporting Capabilities
With the information entered into the system, it should be able to:
- Compile the total number of pages read.
- Report the total number of pages read in each Dewey Decimal System category.
  - When a book is “partially read” we will only put half of the pages (total pages
/ 2) toward the total count.

### Dewey Decimal Classification
For your convenience, here are the Dewey Decimal System’s categories:
- 000 – Computer Science, Information & General Works

- 400 – Language
